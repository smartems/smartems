# InfluxDB Data Source -  Native Plugin

smartEMS ships with **built in** support for InfluxDB (> 0.9.x).

There are currently two separate data sources for InfluxDB in smartEMS: InfluxDB 0.8.x and the latest InfluxDB release. The API and capabilities of latest (> 0.9.x) InfluxDB are completely different from InfluxDB 0.8.x which is why smartEMS handles them as different data sources.

InfluxDB 0.8 is no longer maintained by InfluxDB Inc, but we provide support as a convenience to existing users. You can find it [here](https://smartems.com/plugins/smartems-influxdb-08-datasource).
